    "   - **Assumption:** Assumes that the features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",

    "   - **Assumption:** Assumes that the features are multinomially distributed, which is suitable for discrete data, such as word counts in text classification.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases:** Often used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, where the data can be represented as word frequency vectors.\n",

    "   from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "   - **Assumption:** Assumes that the features are binary (Bernoulli-distributed), representing the presence or absence of a particular feature.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases:** Suitable for binary or boolean features. Commonly used in document classification tasks where each feature represents the presence or absence of a term in a document.\n",

    "  - Choose Multinomial Naive Bayes for discrete count data, especially in text classification.\n",
    "  - Choose Bernoulli Naive Bayes for binary feature data.\n",

    "  - If the assumptions of a particular variant are strongly violated, its performance may degrade. For example, if the features are not normally distributed, Gaussian Naive Bayes might not be the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Independence:**\n",
    "  - Naive Bayes classifiers assume that features are conditionally independent given the class label. This \"naive\" assumption might not hold in all cases, but Naive Bayes can still perform well in practice.\n",

    "  - Naive Bayes classifiers are known for being simple and computationally efficient, making them suitable for large datasets.\n",

    "  - Depending on the programming language and libraries you are using, the availability and ease of use of different Naive Bayes variants may influence your choice.\n",
